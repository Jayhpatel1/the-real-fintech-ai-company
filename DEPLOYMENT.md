📍 **Preview URL:** https://the-real-fintech-ai-company--therealfintech-k4eirq0t.web.app  

## 🌍 Custom Domain Setup (therealfintech.com)

### Step 1: Add Custom Domain in Firebase Console
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/the-real-fintech-ai-company)
2. Navigate to **Hosting**
3. Click **Add custom domain**
4. Enter `therealfintech.com`
5. Follow the verification steps

### Step 2: Configure DNS in Google Domains
Since you're using Google Domains, configure these DNS records:

#### For www.therealfintech.com:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Data: the-real-fintech-ai-company.web.app.
```

#### For therealfintech.com (root domain):
```
Type: A
Name: @
Data: 151.101.1.195
Data: 151.101.65.195
```

OR use CNAME flattening if available:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Data: the-real-fintech-ai-company.web.app.
```

### Step 3: SSL Certificate
Firebase automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains. This may take a few hours to complete.
