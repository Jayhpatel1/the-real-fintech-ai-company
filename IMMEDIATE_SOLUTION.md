1. **Find therealfintech.com** → Click DNS
2. **ADD the TXT record** from Firebase for verification
3. **KEEP the existing A record** pointing to `34.1.219.89` (DON'T change it)
4. **Save DNS records**

### STEP 3: Verify in Firebase (1 minute)

- **4-24 hours:** Full global propagation

## 🧪 TEST COMMANDS:
```bash
# Check verification status
nslookup -type=TXT therealfintech.com

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Why It's Not Working
The domain `therealfintech.com` is pointing to Firebase servers, but Firebase doesn't know it should serve your website for that domain. You MUST add it in Firebase Console.

## 🎉 EXPECTED RESULT:
After adding the custom domain in Firebase Console:
- ✅ **http://therealfintech.com** → Works immediately
- ✅ **https://therealfintech.com** → Works within 1-4 hours
- ✅ **SSL certificate** → Auto-provisioned by Firebase
- ✅ **All AI features** → Working perfectly

## 🔄 BACKUP PLAN:
If Firebase domain setup takes too long, you can immediately redirect therealfintech.com to the working Firebase URL using a simple HTML redirect.

---

**URGENT:** Add therealfintech.com as custom domain in Firebase Console NOW!
**Working URL:** https://the-real-fintech-ai-company--therealfintech-k4eirq0t.web.app
**ETA:** HTTPS working within 1-4 hours after Firebase setup
