# Custom Domain Setup for therealfintech.com

## Current Status
✅ **Website is LIVE and working at:** https://the-real-fintech-ai-company.web.app
✅ **Hindi text has been removed and replaced with English**
✅ **DNS records are configured correctly**
❌ **Custom domain SSL certificate needs to be configured**

## Steps to Complete Custom Domain Setup

### 1. Add Custom Domain in Firebase Console
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/the-real-fintech-ai-company/hosting/main)
2. Click on "Hosting" in the left sidebar
3. Click on "Add custom domain"
4. Enter `therealfintech.com`
5. Follow the verification steps

### 2. Domain Verification
Firebase will provide you with a TXT record to add to your DNS:
- Record type: `TXT`
- Name: `@` (or leave blank)
- Value: (Firebase will provide this)

### 3. DNS Configuration (Already Done ✅)
Your DNS is already correctly configured:
- A records pointing to Firebase IPs: 199.36.158.100, 199.36.158.101
- CNAME for www pointing to: the-real-fintech-ai-company.web.app

### 4. SSL Certificate
After domain verification, Firebase will automatically provision an SSL certificate. This can take up to 24 hours.

## Alternative: Use Firebase Web App URL
Your website is already live and working perfectly at:
**https://the-real-fintech-ai-company.web.app**

## Verification Commands
Run these commands to check status:

```bash
# Check if domain resolves
dig therealfintech.com A

# Check CNAME for www
dig www.therealfintech.com CNAME

# Test Firebase hosted site
curl -s https://the-real-fintech-ai-company.web.app | head -5
```

## Next Steps
1. Complete the domain verification in Firebase Console
2. Wait for SSL certificate provisioning (up to 24 hours)
3. Test the custom domain once SSL is ready

The website is fully functional with all Hindi text removed and replaced with English!
